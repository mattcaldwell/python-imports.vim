== python-imports.vim ==

This VIM plugin automates the insertion of <code>import</code> statements at the top of a file.

=== Example usage ===
In an empty file, type
 sys.exit(1)
Place the cursor over the function call and press Strg + f. The plugin will insert the statement
 import sys
above this line.

It checks if the module was already imported and tries to maintain the import
statements at the file's top in order.

See [http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=4007 the VIM homepage] for further information.
